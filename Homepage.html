    <b><i>Speedcubing (also known as speedsolving, or cubing) is a competitive sport that involves solving combination puzzles as quickly as you can</i></b>, like the 3x3x3 puzzle. 
    Someone who solves twisty puzzles is called a <b>speedcuber</b> (when they focus on speed), or a cuber.
     Solving usually involves making a series of moves or sequences that transform a scrambled puzzle into a solved one, with a solid color on every side.

    It's mostly regulated by the World Cube Association (WCA). The WCA currently recognizes 17 speedcubing events:
     <b>Cube puzzles from 2x2 to 7x7, Pyraminx, Megaminx, Skewb, Square-1, Rubik's Clocks, 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 Blindfolded, 3x3 One-handed, 3x3 Fewest Moves, and 3x3 Multi-blind.</b>
Yusheng Du set the 3x3x3 world record in the Wuhu Open 2018 in 3.47 seconds as of March 2023. Yiheng Wang, a 9 year old cubing prodigy from China, set the world record for a trimmed average of five solves in 4.69 seconds.
